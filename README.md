### Proposal idea
In the Virtual Dressing Room project, we aim to revolutionise the online 
shopping experience by leveraging cutting-edge Generative AI models. Our 
primary objective is to empower users to make more informed purchasing 
decisions, all from the comfort of their own homes. \
As a result of our project, we will provide users with the opportunity to 
evaluate, from the comfort of their own home, whether a particular article 
of clothing is suitable for them using a Generative AI model. To achieve 
this, we are going to explore and test various generative neural networks 
and methods, drawing inspiration from renowned research papers. \
The goal is to identify and implement the best-performing model that 
guarantees lifelike fabric draping, accurate fit visualisation, and 
precise representation of colours and patterns. \
Our virtual fitting room will offer a catalogue of clothing items and 
accessories from which users can choose. Users will be able to upload 
photos and select items they want to try on virtually. \
By integrating the latest advancements in AI technology with an unwavering 
commitment to user satisfaction, our Virtual Dressing Room project is 
poised to reshape the way people shop for clothing online, making it not 
just convenient but truly enjoyable and trustworthy.
